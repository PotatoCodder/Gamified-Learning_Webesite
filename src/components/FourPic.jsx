        Wind is the natural movement of the air from one place to another. It affects the climate of a place. There are three major air streams that greatly affect our climate. From November to February, mornings are colder because of the northeast monsoon wind. It blows from Siberia which is a very frigid place. It brings along temperature and rain that make us shiver. The wind from June to October, is warm and humid. During this time, the western section of our country experiences strong rains brought about by the southwest monsoon wind blowing from Australia. From March to early May, trade winds coming from the east or northeast reach the Philippines. It brings rains to the eastern part of our country. Trade winds are warm and moist and bring hot temperature with little rain. Isn't it amazing that each one of these air streams brings some amount of rain to the Philippines?

          before it gets dark.
